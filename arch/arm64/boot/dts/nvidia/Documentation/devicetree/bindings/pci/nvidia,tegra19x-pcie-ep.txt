NVIDIA Tegra PCIe controller-End Point mode (Synopsys DesignWare Core based)

This PCIe controller working in end point mode is based on the Synopsis
Designware PCIe IP

Required properties:
- compatible: For Tegra19x, must contain "nvidia,tegra194-pcie-ep".
- reg: A list of physical base address and length for each set of controller
  registers. Must contain an entry for each entry in the reg-names property.
- reg-names: Must include the following entries:
  "appl": Controller's application logic registers
  "window1": First address space aperture window available for PCIe controller
  "config": configuration space region (either window1 or window2 can be used
            for mapping. But in this case, window1 is used)
  "atu_dma": iATU and DMA register (either window1 or window2 can be used
             for mapping. But in this case, window1 is used)
  "window2": Second address space aperture window available for PCIe controller
- interrupts: A list of interrupt outputs of the controller. Must contain an
  entry for each entry in the interrupt-names property.
- interrupt-names: Must include the following entries:
  "intr": The Tegra interrupt that is asserted for controller interrupts
- clocks: Must contain an entry for each entry in clock-names.
  See ../clocks/clock-bindings.txt for details.
- clock-names: Must include the following entries:
  - core_clk
- resets: Must contain an entry for each entry in reset-names.
  See ../reset/reset.txt for details.
- reset-names: Must include the following entries:
  - core_apb_rst
  - core_rst
- phys: Must contain a phandle to P2U PHY for each entry in phy-names.
- phy-names: Must include an entry for each active lane. Note that the number
  of entries does not have to (though usually will) be equal to the specified
  number of lanes in XBAR configuration. Entries are of the form
  "pcie-p2u-N": where N ranges from 0 to the value specified in xbar config
- nvidia,pex-rst-gpio: Specify GPIO for PCIe reset signal, see gpio binding
- vddio-pex-ctl-supply: Regulator supply for PCIe side band signals
- Controller dependent register offsets
  - nvidia,margin-port-cap: MARGIN_PORT_CAP_STATUS reg offset
      0x190 - C4
      0x194 - C0 and C5
  - nvidia,cfg-link-cap-l1sub: L1SUB_CAP_L1SUB reg offset
      0x1b0 - C4
      0x1c4 - C0 and C5
  - nvidia,event-cntr-ctrl: EVENT_COUNTER_CONTROL reg offset
      0x1c4 - C4
      0x1d8 - C0 and C5
  - nvidia,event-cntr-data: EVENT_COUNTER_DATA reg offset
      0x1c8 - C4
      0x1dc - C0 and C5
  - nvidia,margin-lane-cntrl: MARGIN_LANE_CNTRL_STATUS reg offset
      0x184 - C1, C2 and C3
      0x194 - C4
      0x198 - C0 and C5
- nvidia,device-id: Controller specific PCIe Device-ID
      0x1AD4 - C0
      0x1AD5 - C4
      0x1AD4 - C5
- nvidia,controller-id : Controller specific ID
      0x0 - C0
      0x4 - C4
      0x5 - C5
- num-lanes: Must contain an entry to represent number of lanes
  controller is given to get the link up

Optional properties:
- iommus: A reference to the IOMMU. See ../iommu/iommu.txt for details.
- dma-coherent: Indicates that the hardware IP block can ensure the coherency
  of the data transferred from/to the IP block. This can avoid the software
  cache flush/invalid actions, and improve the performance significantly.
- nvidia,max-speed: limits controllers max speed to this value.
    1 - Gen-1
    2 - Gen-2
    3 - Gen-3
    4 - Gen-4
- nvidia,disable-aspm-states : controls advertisement of ASPM states
    bit-0 to '1' : disables advertisement of ASPM-L0s
    bit-1 to '1' : disables advertisement of ASPM-L1. This also disables
                 advertisement of ASPM-L1.1 and ASPM-L1.2
    bit-2 to '1' : disables advertisement of ASPM-L1.1
    bit-3 to '1' : disables advertisement of ASPM-L1.2
- nvidia,update_fc_fixup : needs it to improve perf when a platform is designed
    in such a way that it satisfies at least one of the following conditions
    1. If C0/C4/C5 run at x1/x2 link widths (irrespective of speed and MPS)
    2. If C0/C4/C5 operate at their respective max link widths and
       a) speed is Gen-2 and MPS is 256B
       b) speed is >= Gen-3 with any MPS
- nvidia,bar0-size: Size of BAR-0 through which memory gets exposed to host
- "nvidia,tsa-config" : Add TSA configuration register address to configure MC
    with production settings for PCIe. Note:- this is applicable only for C5
- "nvidia,mods" : Add to indicate NVidia specific MODs configuration
