NVIDIA Tegra PCIe controller (Synopsys DesignWare Core based)

This PCIe host controller is based on the Synopsis Designware PCIe IP
and thus inherits all the common properties defined in designware-pcie.txt.

Required properties:
- compatible: For Tegra19x, must contain "nvidia,tegra194-pcie".
- device_type: Must be "pci"
- reg: A list of physical base address and length for each set of controller
  registers. Must contain an entry for each entry in the reg-names property.
- reg-names: Must include the following entries:
  "appl": Controller's application logic registers
  "config": configuration space region
  "atu_dma": iATU and DMA register
- interrupts: A list of interrupt outputs of the controller. Must contain an
  entry for each entry in the interrupt-names property.
- interrupt-names: Must include the following entries:
  "intr": The Tegra interrupt that is asserted for controller interrupts
  "msi": The Tegra interrupt that is asserted when an MSI is received
- bus-range: Range of bus numbers associated with this controller
- #address-cells: Address representation for root ports (must be 3)
  - cell 0 specifies the bus and device numbers of the root port:
    [23:16]: bus number
    [15:11]: device number
  - cell 1 denotes the upper 32 address bits and should be 0
  - cell 2 contains the lower 32 address bits and is used to translate to the
    CPU address space
- #size-cells: Size representation for root ports (must be 2)
- ranges: Describes the translation of addresses for root ports and standard
  PCI regions. The entries must be 6 cells each, where the first three cells
  correspond to the address as described for the #address-cells property
  above, the fourth cell is the physical CPU address to translate to and the
  fifth and six cells are as described for the #size-cells property above.
  - Entries setup the mapping for the standard I/O, memory and
    prefetchable PCI regions. The first cell determines the type of region
    that is setup:
    - 0x81000000: I/O memory region
    - 0x82000000: non-prefetchable memory region
    - 0xc2000000: prefetchable memory region
  Please refer to the standard PCI bus binding document for a more detailed
  explanation.
- #interrupt-cells: Size representation for interrupts (must be 1)
- interrupt-map-mask and interrupt-map: Standard PCI IRQ mapping properties
  Please refer to the standard PCI bus binding document for a more detailed
  explanation.
- clocks: Must contain an entry for each entry in clock-names.
  See ../clocks/clock-bindings.txt for details.
- clock-names: Must include the following entries:
  - core_clk
- resets: Must contain an entry for each entry in reset-names.
  See ../reset/reset.txt for details.
- reset-names: Must include the following entries:
  - core_apb_rst
  - core_rst
- phys: Must contain a phandle to P2U PHY for each entry in phy-names.
- phy-names: Must include an entry for each active lane. Note that the number
  of entries does not have to (though usually will) be equal to the specified
  number of lanes in XBAR configuration. Entries are of the form
  "pcie-p2u-N": where N ranges from 0 to the value specified in xbar config
