config BCMDHD_QMONITOR
	bool "Monitoring the DHD queue utilization"
	depends on BCMDHD
	---help---
	  The feature allows monitoring the DHD queue utilization
	  to get the percentage of a time period where the number of
	  pending packets is above a configurable theshold.
	  Based on IOVAR "qtime_percent" results, the server indicates
	  to the Video Encoder if its bitrate can be increased or
	  must be decreased. Currently, this works only with P2P interfaces
	  and with PROP_TXSTATUS.
