Subject: [PATCH 011/371] futex: Rework inconsistent rt_mutex/futex_q state
X-NVConfidentiality: public

Upstream commit 73d786bd043ebc855f349c81ea805f6b11cbf2aa

There is a weird state in the futex_unlock_pi() path when it interleaves
with a concurrent futex_lock_pi() at the point where it drops hb->lock.

In this case, it can happen that the rt_mutex wait_list and the futex_q
disagree on pending waiters, in particular rt_mutex will find no pending
waiters where futex_q thinks there are. In this case the rt_mutex unlock
code cannot assign an owner.

The futex side fixup code has to cleanup the inconsistencies with quite a
bunch of interesting corner cases.

Simplify all this by changing wake_futex_pi() to return -EAGAIN when this
situation occurs. This then gives the futex_lock_pi() code the opportunity
to continue and the retried futex_unlock_pi() will now observe a coherent
state.

The only problem is that this breaks RT timeliness guarantees. That
is, consider the following scenario:

  T1 and T2 are both pinned to CPU0. prio(T2) > prio(T1)

    CPU0

    T1
      lock_pi()
      queue_me()  <- Waiter is visible

    preemption

    T2
      unlock_pi()
	loops with -EAGAIN forever

Which is undesirable for PI primitives. Future patches will rectify
this.
