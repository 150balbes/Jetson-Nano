Subject: [PATCH 030/371] futex,rt_mutex: Fix rt_mutex_cleanup_proxy_lock()
X-NVConfidentiality: public

Markus reported that the glibc/nptl/tst-robustpi8 test was failing after
commit:

  cfafcd117da0 ("futex: Rework futex_lock_pi() to use rt_mutex_*_proxy_lock()")

The following trace shows the problem:

 ld-linux-x86-64-2161  [019] ....   410.760971: SyS_futex: 00007ffbeb76b028: 80000875  op=FUTEX_LOCK_PI

 ld-linux-x86-64-2165  [011] ....   410.760980: SyS_futex: 00007ffbeb76b028: 80000871 ret=0000

Task 2165 does an UNLOCK_PI, assigning the lock to the waiter task 2161
which then returns with -ETIMEDOUT. That wrecks the lock state, because now
the owner isn't aware it acquired the lock and removes the pending robust
list entry.

If 2161 is killed, the robust list will not clear out this futex and the
subsequent acquire on this futex will then (correctly) result in -ESRCH
which is unexpected by glibc, triggers an internal assertion and dies.

Task 2161			Task 2165

rt_mutex_wait_proxy_lock()
   timeout();
   /* T2161 is still queued in  the waiter list */
   return -ETIMEDOUT;

				futex_unlock_pi()
				spin_lock(hb->lock);
				rtmutex_unlock()
				  remove_rtmutex_waiter(T2161);
				   mark_lock_available();
				/* Make the next waiter owner of the user space side */
				futex_uval = 2161;
				spin_unlock(hb->lock);
spin_lock(hb->lock);
rt_mutex_cleanup_proxy_lock()
  if (rtmutex_owner() !== current)
     ...
     return FAIL;
....
return -ETIMEOUT;

This means that rt_mutex_cleanup_proxy_lock() needs to call
try_to_take_rt_mutex() so it can take over the rtmutex correctly which was
assigned by the waker. If the rtmutex is owned by some other task then this
call is harmless and just confirmes that the waiter is not able to acquire
it.

While there, fix what looks like a merge error which resulted in
rt_mutex_cleanup_proxy_lock() having two calls to
fixup_rt_mutex_waiters() and rt_mutex_wait_proxy_lock() not having any.
Both should have one, since both potentially touch the waiter list.
