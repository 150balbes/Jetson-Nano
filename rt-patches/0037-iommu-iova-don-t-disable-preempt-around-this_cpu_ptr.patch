Subject: [PATCH 037/371] iommu/iova: don't disable preempt around
 this_cpu_ptr()
X-NVConfidentiality: public

Commit 583248e6620a ("iommu/iova: Disable preemption around use of
this_cpu_ptr()") disables preemption while accessing a per-CPU variable.
This does keep lockdep quiet. However I don't see the point why it is
bad if we get migrated after its access to another CPU.
__iova_rcache_insert() and __iova_rcache_get() immediately locks the
variable after obtaining it - before accessing its members.
_If_ we get migrated away after retrieving the address of cpu_rcache
before taking the lock then the *other* task on the same CPU will
retrieve the same address of cpu_rcache and will spin on the lock.

alloc_iova_fast() disables preemption while invoking
free_cpu_cached_iovas() on each CPU. The function itself uses
per_cpu_ptr() which does not trigger a warning (like this_cpu_ptr()
does) because it assumes the caller knows what he does because he might
access the data structure from a different CPU (which means he needs
protection against concurrent access).
