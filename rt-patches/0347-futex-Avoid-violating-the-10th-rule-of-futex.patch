Subject: [PATCH 347/371] futex: Avoid violating the 10th rule of futex
X-NVConfidentiality: public

[ Upstream commit c1e2f0eaf015fb7076d51a339011f2383e6dd389 ]

Julia reported futex state corruption in the following scenario:

   waiter                                  waker                                            stealer (prio > waiter)

   futex(WAIT_REQUEUE_PI, uaddr, uaddr2,
         timeout=[N ms])
      futex_wait_requeue_pi()
         futex_wait_queue_me()
            freezable_schedule()
            <scheduled out>
                                           futex(LOCK_PI, uaddr2)
                                           futex(CMP_REQUEUE_PI, uaddr,
                                                 uaddr2, 1, 0)
                                              /* requeues waiter to uaddr2 */
                                           futex(UNLOCK_PI, uaddr2)
                                                 wake_futex_pi()
                                                    cmp_futex_value_locked(uaddr2, waiter)
                                                    wake_up_q()
           <woken by waker>
           <hrtimer_wakeup() fires,
            clears sleeper->task>
                                                                                           futex(LOCK_PI, uaddr2)
                                                                                              __rt_mutex_start_proxy_lock()
                                                                                                 try_to_take_rt_mutex() /* steals lock */
                                                                                                    rt_mutex_set_owner(lock, stealer)
                                                                                              <preempted>
         <scheduled in>
         rt_mutex_wait_proxy_lock()
            __rt_mutex_slowlock()
               try_to_take_rt_mutex() /* fails, lock held by stealer */
               if (timeout && !timeout->task)
                  return -ETIMEDOUT;
            fixup_owner()
               /* lock wasn't acquired, so,
                  fixup_pi_state_owner skipped */

   return -ETIMEDOUT;

   /* At this point, we've returned -ETIMEDOUT to userspace, but the
    * futex word shows waiter to be the owner, and the pi_mutex has
    * stealer as the owner */

   futex_lock(LOCK_PI, uaddr2)
     -> bails with EDEADLK, futex word says we're owner.

And suggested that what commit:

  73d786bd043e ("futex: Rework inconsistent rt_mutex/futex_q state")

removes from fixup_owner() looks to be just what is needed. And indeed
it is -- I completely missed that requeue_pi could also result in this
case. So we need to restore that, except that subsequent patches, like
commit:

  16ffa12d7425 ("futex: Pull rt_mutex_futex_unlock() out from under hb->lock")

changed all the locking rules. Even without that, the sequence:

-               if (rt_mutex_futex_trylock(&q->pi_state->pi_mutex)) {
-                       locked = 1;
-                       goto out;
-               }

-               raw_spin_lock_irq(&q->pi_state->pi_mutex.wait_lock);
-               owner = rt_mutex_owner(&q->pi_state->pi_mutex);
-               if (!owner)
-                       owner = rt_mutex_next_owner(&q->pi_state->pi_mutex);
-               raw_spin_unlock_irq(&q->pi_state->pi_mutex.wait_lock);
-               ret = fixup_pi_state_owner(uaddr, q, owner);

already suggests there were races; otherwise we'd never have to look
at next_owner.

So instead of doing 3 consecutive wait_lock sections with who knows
what races, we do it all in a single section. Additionally, the usage
of pi_state->owner in fixup_owner() was only safe because only the
rt_mutex owner would modify it, which this additional case wrecks.

Luckily the values can only change away and not to the value we're
testing, this means we can do a speculative test and double check once
we have the wait_lock.
